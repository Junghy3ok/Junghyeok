        <p>"Dear Ack, I want to apologize for my behavior. I realize that I have caused you sadness and I want you to know that I'm truly sorry. I made a mistake and I shouldn't have acted that way. Please forgive me and give me the opportunity to make things right. I'm willing to work to regain your trust and show you that I can be a better person. With love and sincerity, Ack.
